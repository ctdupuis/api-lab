Check if the POST request accept params, queries, and/or a body. Which one(s) and what information is it expecting to be sent?

-An array of all the posts

What would the URL look like for deleting the post with the id 555? (This post does not exist anymore, but the syntax is the same for existing posts)
-DELETE https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts?id=555

List the possible response codes from the GET request at /posts/filter
-200, 409

Create a post whose text is your name, record the URL and body here:
-POST https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts body = { "text": "Cody Dupuis" }
https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/filter?text=Cody%20Dupuis to find my post id { id: 134 }

What would the URL and body object be to update the post you just made to contain your faovrite color instead of your name?
-PUT https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts?id=134 body { "text": "My favorite color is red" }

-GET https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/filter?text=blue

Make a request to GET all the posts. What are the content type and charset of the response? (Hint: look on the Headers)
-GET https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts

-Charset: utf-8

What would cause a PUT request to return a 409 status?
-Request was missing req.query.id or req.body.text

What happens if you try to send a query in the GET request URL? Why do you get that response?
-You still end up getting all of the posts. The API accounts for /filter to be in the URL when trying to send a query
